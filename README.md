# cord Coding Challenge (Front-end)

### Movie Database Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for cord. The task is to create a (SPA) single page application that can host movies. The application must have search functionalities implemented and must be device responsive. A mock-up has been provided and all designs have been completed accordingly and several API calls have been made to public MovieDB API.

### How to Install and Run

Simply cloning the repo, running "yarn build" and then "yarn start" is enough to run the application locally. The application currently does not have any remote deployment set-up.

### Technologies Used.

The application has been built using React, HTML and CSS all for the Front-End. Typescript was also implemented to improve the efficiency and precision of the code.

The application makes use of several libraries:

- React-Router-Dom
- Styled-Components
- Node-Sass
- Framer-Motion
- React-Icons
- Axios

### Submission guide

Please fork this repo and drop your contact person a note once you are done

### How we review

- **Design**: Were you able to translate the mockup into a web application that works well on various browsers and devices? Does the output match the mockup? Are all the required interactions implemented? This is the most important aspect. Weight: 50%
- **Functionality**: Does the search function work? Do the results load instantly as the user types? If the API backend has rate limiting enforced, how do you implement the aforementioned while also taking rate limiting into account? Weight: 25%
- **Code quality**: Is the code easy to understand and maintain? Is the coding style consistent with the language's best practices? Do you demonstrate a good grasp of JavaScript, especially ES6? Weight: 15%
- **Performance**: Does the UI render quickly? Are the choice of libraries etc appropriate for the web page? Weight: 10%

### Bonus points

- **Automated Tests** - Are there any automated frontend tests?
- **Documentation** - Is the README well written? Are the commit messages clear?
- **Reporting** - React Profiler report with demonstrated knowledge of reading / reporting performance data
- **Production-readiness** - Is there proper error handling? Is the code ready to put into production? Code-Splitting?
- **Future-readiness** - React Hooks? Web workers? PWA? Client-side caching?
