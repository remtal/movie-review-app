# cord Coding Challenge (Front-end)

### Movie Database Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for cord. The task is to create a (SPA) single page application that can host movies. The application must have search functionalities implemented and must be device responsive. A mock-up has been provided and all designs have been completed accordingly and several API calls have been made to public MovieDB API.

### How to Install and Run

Simply cloning the repo, running "yarn build" and then "yarn start" is enough to run the application locally. The application currently does not have any remote deployment set-up.

### Technologies Used.

The application has been built using React, HTML and CSS all for the Front-End. Typescript was also implemented to improve the efficiency and precision of the code.

The application makes use of several libraries:

- React-Router-Dom
- Styled-Components
- Node-Sass
- Framer-Motion
- React-Icons
- Axios
